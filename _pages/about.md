About me
======
I'm an assistant professor at the [Wharton Statistics Department](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). My [research](https://ekatsevi.github.io/research/) centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory, methodology, and applications. I work on modern **genomics** applications, which often inspire me to consider methodological and theoretical problems in **high-dimensional variable selection**, **multiple testing**, and **selective inference** (see below). I greatly enjoy [teaching and mentoring](https://ekatsevi.github.io/mentoring/), and am actively seeking PhD students. Please reach out to me if you're interested!
