I have benefited from the guidance of many great mentors over the years, and I know that mentoring is particularly important for graduate students. I strive to support students to the best of my ability, and to cultivate a friendly and open intellectual environment. I look forward to advising students on theoretical, methodological, and applied research projects. If you are interested in learning more, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email.

Advice for PhD students
------
PhD students must master a variety of non-statistical skills, and these skills are often acquired through osmosis or trial-and-error. To speed the process along, I have compiled some advice on such topics based on my personal experience. These pages are exclusively my own opinions, and are far from comprehensive. I'd like to add more topics, so please let me know if there's something of this sort that would be helpful to you.

Along similar lines, [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) (Assistant Professor at CMU) has also compiled ["checklists"](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/checklists.html) for stat/ML PhD students that I find quite helpful.
